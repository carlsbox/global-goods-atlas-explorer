    "description": "Global goods are open-source digital tools and resources that can be adapted to different countries and contexts to help solve health system challenges and accelerate impact. The Global Goods Guidebook recognises that to become truly global, a tool must meet clear criteria – including open licensing, alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and compliance with the Digital Public Good standard. To ensure that digital tools and content can scale sustainably and be reused across programmes, Digital Square has developed Global Goods Maturity Models. These models provide a structured way for developers and implementers to assess where their project stands and what steps are needed to achieve 'global good' status. The models also provide a consistent framework to compare tools, supporting evidence-based decision-making, and encourage continuous improvement whilst also promoting global alignment."

    "title": "What are the maturity models?",
    "content": "The maturity models help developers, implementers and government decision-makers to understand how far a digital product has progressed from early prototype to a robust, widely adopted global good. Since 2017, Digital Square has curated and continuously updated these models in close collaboration with the global digital health community. Developed through extensive consultation, they incorporate insights from a diverse range of experts, regional digital health networks, the Digital Public Goods Alliance and multilateral organizations including WHO, WMO and UNICEF. The models emphasise open collaboration and encourage continuous improvement, creating a consistent framework for comparing tools and supporting evidence-based decision-making."
