DPI is essential for integrating climate and health data, allowing policymakers and health leaders to make informed decisions as they build climate-resilient health systems. By combining satellite data, weather patterns, and health sector insights, we can better predict disease outbreaks, respond to changing health needs, and mitigate the impact of extreme weather events.

              The health impacts of climate change are no longer a distant concern. They are here, now, affecting people and health systems around the world in diverse and unequal ways. From shifting patterns of disease to more frequent heat waves and extreme weather, understanding, monitoring, and preventing the nexus of health risks amplified by changing weather and climate have never been more urgent.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              To support countries in addressing these growing risks, the Joint Programme office is a unique partnership bringing together science, policy, information, and action to support governments and partners to better anticipate and respond to health risks of weather and climate.

            <p>
              This Global Goods Guidebook Climate Services for Health Annex is part of that effort. While DPI has not historically been designed with climate resilience in mind, it plays a vital role in building it. Service delivery components such as telemedicine, supply chain management, and patient record systems actively support health systems to handle climate challenges better. Furthermore, climate- and health-focused digital global goods can strengthen DPI by providing open, interoperable tools and data systems that integrate climate information into health decision-making. Climate-enabled health DPI can accelerate the access and use of standardized climate information more easily and accelerate efforts to predict, prepare, and respond to climate-related health risks in coordinated and scalable ways by considering the influence of weather and climate on health risk, the timing of vector control, opening of cooling centers, and issuing public advisories that are more precise and protective.

              Effective climate-health integration requires strong collaboration across sectors, better data access, user-centered systems, and expanded training opportunities. WMO's global network, built through decades of cooperation among its member states, enables the collection, processing, and sharing of vital weather, climate, and environmental observations, information, and services. But data alone are not enough. They must be translated into actionable information for health professionals, whether they're managing a disease surveillance system, designing an early warning tool, or writing a national adaptation plan.

              Climate change is recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a significant global public health threat. It acts as a threat multiplier, exacerbating existing systemic vulnerabilities across populations and health systems. The increasing frequency of extreme weather events and gradual climatic shifts escalate risks to human well-being, livelihoods, and health, while also placing health systems under considerable strain. These environmental changes can impact biodiversity, food security, nutrition, air quality, and access to safe water, contributing to an increase in food-, water-, and vector-borne diseases. The Seventy-Seventh World Health Assembly in 2024 highlighted this critical issue through resolution WHA77.14, which calls for global action to foster health and develop climate-resilient, sustainable health systems. Building on this momentum, in May 2025, at the Seventy-eighth World Health Assembly, Member States adopted the first-ever draft Global action plan on climate change and health. The draft Global action plan 2025â2028 (EB156(40)) acknowledged the urgent need to address the health impacts of climate change, positioning health systems as part of the climate solution. Each WHA action build upon previous resolutions going back two decades, which acknowledge the interconnectedness of health, environment, and climate change.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              The WHO's Global Strategy on Digital Health, with its mandate recently extended through 2027, provides a framework for how technology can be leveraged for health improvement. This strategy guides countries in the digital transformation of their health systems by focusing on interoperability standards and national digital health architecture. It supports patient-facing systems like telemedicine, point-of-care systems such as Electronic Health Records leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) for enhanced decision support, and the maintenance of global digital public infrastructure, such as verifiable health records through initiatives like the Global Digital Health Certification Network (GDHCN). A key challenge is ensuring these digital health systems can effectively achieve interoperability with the extensive standardized climate and weather data curated by organizations like the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).
            </p>
            
            <p>
              As part of a broader set of recommendations and priority actions, the WHA77.14 resolution specifically urges Member States to enhance their data systems. A key recommendation is to:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-primary pl-6 italic">
              "Integrate climate data into existing monitoring, early warning, surveillance, and data collection systems, including data disaggregated by sex, age, disability, and any other relevant factor, where appropriate."
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>
              This integration is crucial for enabling "evidence-based decision-making and targeted interventions that respond to the impacts of climate change...on health and health systems."
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Technical integration of climate and health information systems provides operational means to ensure critical data streams foster necessary combined evidence to inform more equitable policy choices and ensure that interventions are targeted effectively. The Global Action Plan 2025 - 28 (EB156(40)) similarly notes:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-primary pl-6 italic">
              "Support integrated climate and health data and surveillance systems and identify gaps for integrating climate and weather information into country-level health information systems, including by working through the WMOâWHO Joint Office for Climate and Health to build collaborative partnerships among national meteorological and hydrological services and national ministries of health"
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>
              Achieving true interoperability between diverse datasetsâincluding satellite information, in-situ climate data, and health informationâis vital for understanding and addressing how seasonal variations and extreme weather events can worsen health risks and strain health system capacities.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              To support these efforts, WHO is engaged in key activities aimed at fostering interoperable climate-health solutions. This currently involves:

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Working through initiatives such as the WHO-WMO Joint Office on Climate and Health to advance the use of interoperable digital tools, data, and Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI). The overarching impact of these activities is to enable climate-informed health action by fostering interoperable, sustainable national information systems and supporting data-driven decision-making at all levels.</li>
              <li>Systematically addressing priority climate-health data challenges by documenting standardized "use cases" for operationalizing climate-informed health services. This includes defining essential data, workflows, and system specifications, guided by approaches like the WHO SMART Guidelines.</li>

              <li>Supporting the development and implementation of early warning and surveillance systems, which both serve an operational function and as early adopters of interoperability requirements.</li>
