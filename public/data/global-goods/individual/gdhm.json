    "Summary": "The Global Digital Health Monitor (GDHM) is an interactive digital global public good that helps countries to prioritize and monitor their digital health transformation, using the World Health Organization (WHO)/ International Telecommunications Union (ITU) eHealth Strategy Toolkit as the underlying framework.",
    "Description": "Intended to be used by Ministries of Health, private health and technology sector stakeholders, and international agencies, the GDHM enables countries and regions to benchmark and track progress and maturity over time, advocate for resources, identify countries that are performing well to facilitate cross-country learning, and support private sector entrepreneurs and investors to strategically prioritize new market entry and strategies. Revisions to the GDHM include an update to indicators to align with the WHO Global Strategy for Digital Health 2020-2025, private sector engagement, emerging technologies such as AI, as well as diversity, equity, and inclusion â€“ including a new sub-indicator on gender to address the widening gender digital divide.",

    "SummaryOfReach": "In 2023, 71 countries have completed the GDHM, representing 35% of all countries in the world. An additional 100 countries have data for seven indicators pre-populated with correlated data from publicly available sources. The Global Fund and Gavi have both adopted the GDHM as their digital health maturity model, which they will be using annually to track and prioritize their investments. The GDHM is also being used routinely by UNICEF and Africa CDC. Furthermore, in May 2023, the WHO announced its intention to adopt the GDHM and house it within their suite of digital health resources. Many countries have used the GDHM to inform the development of National Digital Health Strategies. The ones that we are aware of, include Nigeria, Iraq, Zambia, Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, Lao DPR and Indonesia.",
