    "Description": "The Digital Medic team manages the content on an ongoing basis. Local organizations and ministries of health support the implementation of the content. The content was developed with the Community Health Impact Coalition (CHIC) and an advisory group of community health workers from Kenya, Uganda, Liberia, South Africa, Sierra Leone, Malawi, and Guatemala to ensure that all content is action-oriented and reflects the realities of CHWsâ€™ work and the challenges they face. CHIC and this group of CHW advisors piloted the content and provided feedback on an ongoing basis before its public release.  The training has also been adopted by the Uganda Ministry of Health and is being rolled out as part of their national training curriculum, in collaboration with the Nama Wellness Community Centre in Uganda. The content was initially funded by a Johnson & Johnson grant awarded to the Community Health Impact Coalition, which selected Digital Medic as a sub-grantee and partner to develop and host the content. Digital Medic funds ongoing maintenance of the course through internal operational support as well as grant support through the ELMA Foundation",
