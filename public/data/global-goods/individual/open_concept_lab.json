    "Summary": "Open Concept Lab (OCL) is an open source, FHIR-enabled health terminology management system. OCL facilitates the collaborative management, publication, and use of custom medical terminology resources such as diagnoses, observations, lab measurements, reporting indicators, and more.",
    "Description": "OCL also provides access to standardized reference terminologies like the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and is a primary distributor of the Columbia International eHealth Laboratory (CIEL) interface terminology.\n",
    "PrimaryFunctionality": "Organizations use OCL to serve as a central source of truth for data standards and definitions, supporting the normalization of clinical data to achieve semantic interoperability. Common use cases include using OCL as a foundation for a national health data dictionary, building FHIR value sets and concept maps, or managing a concept dictionary for an electronic medical record like OpenMRS. OCL is designed to be used in a shared, cloud-based environment alongside the global community or as a self-hosted architectural component within an organizationâ€™s data exchange architecture.",
    "Users": "Target users are: 1. A Terminology Publisher manages and publishes original terminology resources, leveraging and mapping to reference vocabularies and other user-generated content. 2. A Terminology Implementer adapts and repackages terminology resources from terminology publishers, such as WHO DDCC/SMART Guidelines or CIEL, based on local implementation needs, e.g. by adding a local dialect or mapping to local codes. 3. A Terminology Consumer searches, compares, and exports terminology resources that are relevant to his/her project(s) to achieve a better understand of concepts, to use the right codes, and to navigate relationships between terms.",
