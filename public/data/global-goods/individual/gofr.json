    "Summary": "The Global Open Facility Registry (GOFR) lets health data administrators analyze, de-duplicate, and curate lists of facilities.",
    "Description": "By reconciling data sets maintained by multiple sources, it helps health officials develop registries of all the unique health facilities in a country. Data points such as the name and location of health facilities are essential to health information systems, reporting, and decision-making. However, up-to-date, accurate information on facilities may be difficult to find as different stakeholders with different information needs and naming conventions maintain separate lists. Additionally, governments often do not have access to a flexible, secure platform for facility management and information exchange. GOFR saves time, improves accuracy, and allows administrators to compare data sets, compile lists of facilities, and manage federations.",
    "PrimaryFunctionality": "Health facility registry management, data deduplication, and facility information exchange",
    "Users": "Primary users include data managers at a central level Ministry of Health, managers of facility information, as well as the general public need to look up facility attributes.",
