Tupaia is completely free and open-source.  We combine data from multiple sources including DHIS2, mSupply, Kobo, Tamanu, and our own MediTrak app to help improve medicines' availability, map disease outbreaks, map public health programming, undertake disease surveillance, respond to disasters, and strengthen service provision.",
