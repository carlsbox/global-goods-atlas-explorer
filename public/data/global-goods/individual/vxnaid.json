    "Summary": "Vxnaid is an integrated digital platform ensuring correct administration of vaccines, identification of vaccinees, follow-up/recall of vaccinated persons, and understanding of campaign effectiveness.",
    "Description": "Johnson & Johnson (J&J) Global Public Health team have developed and matured the Vxnaid vaccine monitoring platform over several years. The platform initially was used to support Ebola vaccination studies in the context of a vaccine product development trajectory but quickly was applied in the Public Health context of an Ebola vaccination campaign. Subsequently, the utility and architecture of the platform was broadened to make it supportive of any vaccine type and the platform has since been used in the context of Covid-19 vaccinations. The technology is built on an OpenMRS open source backbone.",
    "PrimaryFunctionality": "The system consists of three integrated modules: (1) vaccinee identification through unique IDs, barcodes, or optional biometric scanning; (2) a reporting dashboard that tracks enrollment, vaccination coverage, compliance, and operational performance, with exportable and DHIS2-compatible data; and (3) a mobile engagement module delivering reminders, updates, and surveys via SMS, WhatsApp, or voice messages in local languages to support follow-up, community engagement, and rumor management.",
    "Users": "The primary users of the system are those executing vaccination campaigns in the field as well as management functions overseeing the performance of the campaigns, e.g. ministries of health.",
