  "ProductOverview": {
    "Summary": "The Android FHIR SDK is a set of Kotlin libraries for building offline-capable, mobile-first healthcare applications using the HL7® FHIR® standard on Android.",
    "Description": "Central to the vision for the Android FHIR SDK is the ability to easily leverage open standards (i.e FHIR) to build next generation digital health solutions that can run open content (e.g. shared FHIR Questionnaires or more formalised Implementation Guides such as a WHO SMART Guideline). By focussing on the open standards we believe this will lead to more developers able to build new interoperable applications that can live side-by-side platforms provided that also build to the FHIR specification (using the FHIR SDK), creating a more open ecosystem for health content and applications.",
    "PrimaryFunctionality": "The Android FHIR SDK makes it easier for developers to build mobile health applications that can leverage the FHIR specification in different ways depending on the type of application they are building. It is made up of three libraries that provide different capabilities that can be leveraged according to the what is needed:  A structured data capture library, a FHIR Engine and a Workflow engine using CQL. ",
    "Users": "Software developers building mobile health solutions or platforms that want to leverage the open FHIR specification and data model. Today the primary users are development teams that are familiar with building healthcare worker facing applications for data collection that requires on-device storage and syncing capabilities. The SDK has been designed to significantly reduce the barriers to adoption of FHIR and to enable any developer with Android skills to build FHIR compliant applications, enabling local developers in countries everywhere to easily pick up the necessary skills and find ways to leverage the FHIR specification for their local needs (i.e they are not locked into any proprietary vendor model).
