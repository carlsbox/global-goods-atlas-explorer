    "Summary": "The Android FHIR SDK is a set of Kotlin libraries for building offline-capable, mobile-first healthcare applications using the HL7® FHIR® standard on Android.",
    "Description": "Central to the vision for the Android FHIR SDK is the ability to easily leverage open standards (i.e FHIR) to build next generation digital health solutions that can run open content (e.g. shared FHIR Questionnaires or more formalised Implementation Guides such as a WHO SMART Guideline). By focussing on the open standards we believe this will lead to more developers able to build new interoperable applications that can live side-by-side platforms provided that also build to the FHIR specification (using the FHIR SDK), creating a more open ecosystem for health content and applications.",

The WHO has been a key collaborator and has provided small funding for early demonstration projects (e.g. COVAX app by Ona, DDCC Verifier App by PathCheck)."
