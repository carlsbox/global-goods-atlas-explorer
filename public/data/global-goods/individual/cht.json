    "Summary": "Digital public good supporting community health workers with configurable mobile applications for health service delivery",
    "Description": "The Community Health Toolkit (CHT) is a digital public good that supports health workers as they deliver care in reimagined health systems. CHT includes a collection of open source software frameworks and applications, with resources to help partners design and deploy digital tools for care teams with the support of an active community of collaborators. CHT's modular tools work together as an integrated platform for infectious disease preparedness, surveillance, and response as well as routine community health services, and can be quickly configured for specific partner needs. Deployments include implementations in both mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar.",
