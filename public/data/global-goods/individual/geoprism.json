      "Description": "GeoPrism Registry (GPR) enables interoperability by location through the simultaneous hosting, management, regular updating, and sharing of master lists, associated hierarchies, and geospatial data for the geographic objects essential to sustainable development, including public health, education, agriculture, infrastructure, extreme weather, and other public and private services. GPR can also integrate data from digital public goods and NSDIs, such as public health and climate, to enhance geospatial awareness in large language models.",

Additionally, it can sustainably bring geo-awareness from such sources into large language models."
