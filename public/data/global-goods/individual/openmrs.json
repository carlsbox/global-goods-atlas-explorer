    "Summary": "OpenMRS is the world's leading open source electronic medical record system platform, designed to be adaptable to different health care delivery systems and settings.",
    "Description": "OpenMRS is a software platform and a reference application which enables design of a customized medical records system with no programming knowledge (although medical and systems analysis knowledge is required). It is a common platform upon which medical informatics efforts in developing countries can be built. The system is based on a conceptual database structure which is not dependent on the actual types of medical information required to be collected or on particular data collection forms and so can be customized for different uses.",
