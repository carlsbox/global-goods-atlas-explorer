    "Summary": "A collaborative open-source platform for electronic medical records in resource-constrained environments. ",
    "Description": "OpenMRS, as an open-source project, provides a unique solution which puts local providers and patients at the center of their health information ecosystem. It allows for low-resource settings, in particular, to benefit from the contributions of others while being able to customize and “own” their own technologies. This is a foundational transformation that allows for local innovation and the development of new solutions to difficult health-related problems. When OpenMRS implementers customize the OpenMRS platform and reference application in response to local user needs and country context, the resulting OpenMRS implementation becomes an essential point-of-service system in a country's health information exchange architecture. The OpenMRS community accompanies this work with a model that supports community development, capacity building, and local ownership. Countries such as Kenya, Nigeria, Mozambique, Haiti, Rwanda, and Uganda have widely adopted OpenMRS as their premier EMR platform or have declared it to be their official EMR.",
    "PrimaryFunctionality": "OpenMRS is a scalable, modular, interoperable, open source electronic medical records platform (EMR), designed for use with other health information systems and in resource-constrained settings. Since OpenMRS’ launch in 2007, more than 6,700 healthcare clinics in over 35 countries are using OpenMRS to provide improved healthcare to 15.8 million patients. OpenMRS provides health care workers with easier and greater access to data from longitudinal patient records that can inform patient care. Increasingly, data from OpenMRS is also used by digital health leaders to inform the public health decisions needed to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals, measure progress towards UNAIDS’ 95-95-95 targets for HIV epidemic control, respond to outbreaks such as Ebola and COVID-19, and achieve universal health coverage.",
