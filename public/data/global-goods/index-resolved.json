The content was developed with the Community Health Impact Coalition (CHIC) and an advisory group of community health workers from Kenya, Uganda, Liberia, South Africa, Sierra Leone, Malawi, and Guatemala to ensure that all content is action-oriented and reflects the realities of CHWs’ work and the challenges they face. CHIC and this group of CHW advisors piloted the content and provided feedback on an ongoing basis before its public release.  The training has also been adopted by the Uganda Ministry of Health and is being rolled out as part of their national training curriculum, in collaboration with the Nama Wellness Community Centre in Uganda. The content was initially funded by a Johnson & Johnson grant awarded to the Community Health Impact Coalition, which selected Digital Medic as a sub-grantee and partner to develop and host the content.

By focussing on the open standards we believe this will lead to more developers able to build new interoperable applications that can live side-by-side platforms provided that also build to the FHIR specification (using the FHIR SDK), creating a more open ecosystem for health content and applications.",
      "PrimaryFunctionality": "The Android FHIR SDK makes it easier for developers to build mobile health applications that can leverage the FHIR specification in different ways depending on the type of application they are building. It is made up of three libraries that provide different capabilities that can be leveraged according to the what is needed:  A structured data capture library, a FHIR Engine and a Workflow engine using CQL. ",
      "Users": "Software developers building mobile health solutions or platforms that want to leverage the open FHIR specification and data model. Today the primary users are development teams that are familiar with building healthcare worker facing applications for data collection that requires on-device storage and syncing capabilities. The SDK has been designed to significantly reduce the barriers to adoption of FHIR and to enable any developer with Android skills to build FHIR compliant applications, enabling local developers in countries everywhere to easily pick up the necessary skills and find ways to leverage the FHIR specification for their local needs (i.e they are not locked into any proprietary vendor model).

CIEL also provides for more accurate and seamless translation of concept codes across terminologies and between versions of code systems and insulates applications and reports from backend coding changes. As part of the OMOP terminologies, CIEL is poised to play a crucial role in migrating LMIC data sources into the OHDSI community and will benefit from multi-lingual translation of the OHDSI documentation including the use of standard vocabularies.",

Data managers would see CIEL content as they migrated their existing concept dictionaries as well as potentially the actual instance data (patient data) as it moves into data warehouses and reporting tools. The standard codes assigned by CIEL would be used for standard reporting to national, international, and local agencies, as well as for financial reporting and clinical decision support.",

      "Summary": "The course, Digital Health: Planning National Systems, is designed to empower ministry leadership with the foundational and technical concepts and planning tools necessary to steer and orient national digital health stakeholders towards an enterprise planning approach.",
      "Description": "The course has been packaged in different ways to appeal to different learner preferences (self-paced, instructor-led, or a combination of all of the above), but all with the same content that can be taken individually or with a broader cohort.  The course across all languages include nine core modules (though the English version has one more on digital financial services), a variety of interactive case study activities, knowledge checks, and instructional videos and animations to guide the learners through key concepts. Each module’s learning content is about 1.5 hours, and the cohort-based, facilitated versions of the course include another 1.5 hours of group activities per module.",
      "PrimaryFunctionality": "The course is designed to empower ministry leadership with the technical concepts and planning tools necessary to steer and orient national digital health stakeholders towards an enterprise planning approach. The curriculum features critical technical concepts, existing best practices, and pragmatic methods, all framed according to the national planning cycle that Ministry of Health officials manage.",
      "Users": "The course is best suited for leaders and managers from health, ICT, and finance ministries who work in Digital Health (eHealth, mHealth, HIS, CHIS, etc) in low and middle income countries. It would also be applicable for in-country stakeholders who work with these ministries such as donors, multi-laterals and UN agencies, and large implementing NGOs to ensure conceptual and planning alignment.",

There are currently 696 members of the DHNPS Alumni Network. They are globally distributed with the vast majority coming from LMICs in the Global South. The goals of the global Alumni Network's Community of Practice are to: 1) Connect with and support fellow DHPNS course alumni network to apply course learnings and achieve their desired outcomes and impact. 2) Share and exchange knowledge on the application of digital health concepts, contextualized adaptations, identified 'best practices,' and lessons learned. 3) Expand on DHPNS course learnings by updating resources and advising on emerging digital health trends and technologies. This course also has partnerships to continue to support the development, design, maintenance and updating of the course and its alumni network, including the WHO, UNICEF, DICE, DSQ, and USAID. A governance body to help manage these partnerships, priorities, and funding resources is also in development.",

      "Summary": "HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is a next-generation interoperability standard created by the standards development organization Health Level 7 (HL7®). HL7 FHIR is designed to enable health data, including clinical and administrative data, to be quickly and efficiently exchanged.",
      "Description": "Healthcare records are increasingly becoming digitized. As patients move around the healthcare ecosystem, their electronic health records must be available, discoverable, and understandable. Further, to support automated clinical decision support and other machine-based processing, the data must also be structured and standardized. HL7 FHIR is a specification based on emerging industry approaches, but informed by years of lessons around requirements, successes and challenges gained through defining and implementing other HL7 standards.",
      "PrimaryFunctionality": " HL7 FHIR can be used as a stand-alone data exchange standard, but can and will also be used in partnership with existing widely used standards. FHIR leverages existing logical and theoretical models to provide a consistent, easy to implement, and rigorous mechanism for exchanging data between healthcare applications.    ",
      "Users": "HL7 FHIR is used deeply and widely by key global health, digital health, electronic health record and interoperability stakeholders across the world. For example, some key user groups are healthcare providers and workers, government stakeholders, public health officials, private sector innovators, payers, pharmaceutical companies, lab and diagnostic leaders, quality improvement experts and health equity trailblazers.

The Global Fund and Gavi have both adopted the GDHM as their digital health maturity model, which they will be using annually to track and prioritize their investments. The GDHM is also being used routinely by UNICEF and Africa CDC. Furthermore, in May 2023, the WHO announced its intention to adopt the GDHM and house it within their suite of digital health resources. Many countries have used the GDHM to inform the development of National Digital Health Strategies. The ones that we are aware of, include Nigeria, Iraq, Zambia, Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, Lao DPR and Indonesia.",

Data points such as the name and location of health facilities are essential to health information systems, reporting, and decision-making. However, up-to-date, accurate information on facilities may be difficult to find as different stakeholders with different information needs and naming conventions maintain separate lists. Additionally, governments often do not have access to a flexible, secure platform for facility management and information exchange. GOFR saves time, improves accuracy, and allows administrators to compare data sets, compile lists of facilities, and manage federations.",

With its advanced geospatial capabilities, IASO provides a structured approach to managing geographic data, optimizing field data collection, and enhancing decision-making.",
      "Description": "ASO's flexible and scalable architecture makes it a powerful solution for organizations seeking to improve data-driven decision-making and operational efficiency.\nIt has been instrumental in updating geographic data in Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, and Burkina Faso, where it also serves as the official georegistry. At the regional level, IASO supports the Global Polio Eradication Initiative in the AFRO region, providing robust geospatial and health facility registry capabilities.   With its advanced geospatial features, IASO is a leading solution for geo-enabled campaign digitalization, enabling precise planning, monitoring, and execution of critical health interventions. Whether for vaccination campaigns (measles, polio, yellow fever, etc.) or the distribution of essential health items (bed nets, seasonal malaria chemoprevention, etc.), IASO ensures efficient targeting and optimized resource allocation.",

Countries use it to capture and maintain high-quality information for health workforce planning, management, regulation, and training.",
      "PrimaryFunctionality": "Many countries experience critical shortages of health workers and struggle to meet the health care needs of their people. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this problem, making it more difficult for health workers to deliver lifesaving, people-centered care. Effective health workforce management is crucial for countries to address these gaps. Human resources managers and other decision-makers require up-to-date and accurate data on the current number of health workers, where they are deployed, their skill sets, and information on vacant posts and migration. Yet many countries lack this information in a central database, making it difficult to locate employee records or aggregate data for analysis. iHRIS is a free and open source software solution that has been used by ministries of health, district health offices, and health care facilities in over 30 countries to more easily collect, maintain, analyze, and manage health workforce data and resources.",

      "Summary": "The OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) is a standardized framework to harmonize diverse health data sources for research and reporting. It enables interoperability and privacy by allowing shared analytics without sharing patient-level data.",
      "Description": "The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) is a data standard designed to harmonize the structure and content of different types of health data such as electronic health records, insurance claims data, health surveys, and other clinical data sources for federated health research and reporting. Developed by the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) community, the OMOP CDM organizes data into domains or tables representing patient demographics, visits, diagnoses, drugs, measurements (lab tests), procedures, and clinical notes. Interoperability is achieved by sharing computer programs written for the OMOP CDM without the need to share the source data, thereby ensuring patient privacy, and allowing data owners to retain control over their data. \n",
      "PrimaryFunctionality": "The primary function of OMOP CDM is to standardize health data that are in different formats to promote interoperability and collaboration. Analytical tools written for the OMOP CDM can be shared among collaborators without the need to exchange the source data, thus provenance and governance of the data remain with the data owner. Open source OHDSI tools have been created to check the quality of data in an OMOP CDM (consistency, conformance, and plausibility) and to visualize the data according to common subgroups (e.g., sex, year of birth, primary diagnoses, medication usage). Programs can be reused when new data partners join a collaborative effort or when additional data from the same partner becomes available. Results among different data partners can be aggregated to increase statistical power of an analysis, make comparisons of data from different partners, test validity in different contexts, and assess generalizability and the like.

      "PrimaryFunctionality": "Organizations use OCL to serve as a central source of truth for data standards and definitions, supporting the normalization of clinical data to achieve semantic interoperability. Common use cases include using OCL as a foundation for a national health data dictionary, building FHIR value sets and concept maps, or managing a concept dictionary for an electronic medical record like OpenMRS. OCL is designed to be used in a shared, cloud-based environment alongside the global community or as a self-hosted architectural component within an organization’s data exchange architecture.",
      "Users": "Target users are: 1. A Terminology Publisher manages and publishes original terminology resources, leveraging and mapping to reference vocabularies and other user-generated content. 2. A Terminology Implementer adapts and repackages terminology resources from terminology publishers, such as WHO DDCC/SMART Guidelines or CIEL, based on local implementation needs, e.g. by adding a local dialect or mapping to local codes. 3. A Terminology Consumer searches, compares, and exports terminology resources that are relevant to his/her project(s) to achieve a better understand of concepts, to use the right codes, and to navigate relationships between terms.",

      "Summary": "OpenEyes is the leading open source electronic patient record (EPR) for ophthalmology. It has been designed by clinicians to be fast in delivering content, fast to navigate, and easy (and fun) to use. ",
      "Description": "OpenEyes benefits from a large and growing body of enthusiastic clinicians determined to make it the EPR that will help health care organisations deliver data-driven patient care in the best way possible. OpenEyes is owned by the community and not by any individual or corporate entity. It can be customised to suit local needs and will scale to connect, seamlessly, primary and secondary eye care. OpenEyes provides an ophthalmic patient record across the globe, enabling clinicians to support clinical pathways such as cataracts, glaucoma, and retinopathy in regions that previously may have had limited access to the tools and resources to so. It is governed, assured, and maintained through the novel Custodian Model, under the custodianship of the Apperta Foundation.",

      "Summary": "OpenHIE is a global mission-driven community of practice dedicated to improving the health of the underserved through open and collaborative development and support of country driven, large scale health information sharing architectures. The OpenHIE community supports interoperability by creating a reusable architectural framework called the OpenHIE Architecture that introduces a service-oriented approach which maximally leverages health information standards, enables flexible implementation by country partners, and supports interchangeability of individual components.",
      "Description": "OpenHIE and its component framework (e.g. Client Registry, Health Worker Registry, Shared Health Record, Terminology Services, etc.) support several standards for sending, receiving and storing clinical and/or administrative data related to patient care.  OpenHIE workflows are the technical data exchange patterns for sharing health data between one or more of the OpenHIE Architecture components and/or other health information systems.  OpenHIE uses community forums and Architecture Summits to incorporate community review and feedback around all of its offerings. It is made up of organizations that endorse the OpenHIE framework and collaborate on OpenHIE resources.",
      "PrimaryFunctionality": "The purpose of the OpenHIE Architecture Specification is to:\n- Provide an overview of the OpenHIE Architecture\n- Articulate the requirements for OpenHIE components\n- Articulate the workflows (data exchanges) that are currently recognized as data exchange patterns to follow\n- Provide a reference for implementers to use in their architecture and/or implementations",

It acts as a reverse proxy to your upstream services and while doing so enables visibility into your service-oriented architecture (SOA) by logging each request and by providing metrics about requests hitting your services. It also provides a central entry point into your SOA and allows you to secure access through mutual TLS or basic-auth.   The OpenHIM is easy to install and can be easily configured to meet your needs through the administration console. You can also extend the OpenHIM to transform or orchestrate requests through the mediator framework.",

      "Summary": "A collaborative open-source platform for electronic medical records in resource-constrained environments. ",
      "Description": "OpenMRS, as an open-source project, provides a unique solution which puts local providers and patients at the center of their health information ecosystem. It allows for low-resource settings, in particular, to benefit from the contributions of others while being able to customize and “own” their own technologies. This is a foundational transformation that allows for local innovation and the development of new solutions to difficult health-related problems. When OpenMRS implementers customize the OpenMRS platform and reference application in response to local user needs and country context, the resulting OpenMRS implementation becomes an essential point-of-service system in a country's health information exchange architecture. The OpenMRS community accompanies this work with a model that supports community development, capacity building, and local ownership. Countries such as Kenya, Nigeria, Mozambique, Haiti, Rwanda, and Uganda have widely adopted OpenMRS as their premier EMR platform or have declared it to be their official EMR.",
      "PrimaryFunctionality": "OpenMRS is a scalable, modular, interoperable, open source electronic medical records platform (EMR), designed for use with other health information systems and in resource-constrained settings. Since OpenMRS’ launch in 2007, more than 6,700 healthcare clinics in over 35 countries are using OpenMRS to provide improved healthcare to 15.8 million patients. OpenMRS provides health care workers with easier and greater access to data from longitudinal patient records that can inform patient care. Increasingly, data from OpenMRS is also used by digital health leaders to inform the public health decisions needed to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals, measure progress towards UNAIDS’ 95-95-95 targets for HIV epidemic control, respond to outbreaks such as Ebola and COVID-19, and achieve universal health coverage.",

      "Summary": "SPICE is an open-source digital platform designed with and for health systems, patients, and communities. SPICE is focused on data-driven, outcomes-focused care at both the community and primary care levels. The platform is certified as a digital public good, FHIR compatible for interoperability, and designed for long-term country ownership by ministries of health.",
      "Description": "SPICE was built on the principles that digitization is not enough, and that data collection alone does not drive outcomes. The platform enables health systems to collect high quality data, coordinated across levels of care, and use data insights to make decisions that drive improved clinical outcomes. We focus on integrating care for a range of primary care areas including tuberculosis (TB), malaria, HIV, diabetes, hypertension, ante- and post-natal care, and immunizations.",
      "PrimaryFunctionality": "Rather than community health– and facility-level care operating in silos, SPICE bi-directionally links community health work with facility services with closed-loop referrals and counter-referrals. Community health workers receive targeted community-based follow-up for longitudinal patient management based on clinical algorithms. At the facility-level doctor visits, pharmacy and lab workflows are augmented by clinical decision support functionality. Ultimately, the community and primary care model enabled by SPICE drives improved health outcomes for patients",
      "Users": "The primary users of the Medtronic LABS SPICE platform include community health workers and healthcare providers like nurses, doctors, and pharmacists. These users leverage the platform to manage and coordinate care more effectively, benefiting from features such as screening, assessment, patient enrollment, medical reviews, and prescription management. The solution is designed to integrate community health work with facility services, enhancing both data-driven decision-making and patient care continuity across different healthcare settings.",

Country-specific platform deployment, training, and capacity building activities are covered at-cost by grant funding. In each country where we deploy SPICE, the intention is for it to be fully owned and sustained by the local government in the long term. Therefore, Medtronic and grant funding is used to cover set-up and ramp-up costs and then the government is responsible for covering the costs to sustain the platform once it has been transitioned to them for full ownership and scale. Key funders/investors of the work over the past 5 years are: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, GIZ, KOICA, Medtronic, Novo Nordisk, Patrick J.

Designed specifically for remote settings and the Asia-Pacific context, Tamanu allows health workers to monitor patients in hospitals, health centers, clinics, and even out in the community, enabling consistent, long-term management of patient conditions. The system is offline-first, with syncing capabilities allowing users to work seamlessly with and without an internet connection. The mobile and desktop versions are fully integrated “out-of-the-box”, meaning there are no third-party integrations required for any core features.",
      "PrimaryFunctionality": "At the hospital level, Tamanu Desktop allows a full suite of functionality, including scheduling, admissions, medication orders, location (ward and bed), department management, lab integrations (via SENAITE/Tamanu Lab), discharges, and patient management (including treatment notes). The desktop application works offline, syncing with a central server whenever an internet connection becomes available.\n\nAt the clinic level, Tamanu Mobile offers functionality to capture diagnoses, treatments, vitals, and the recording of events such as births, ante-natal visits, and deaths. It also contains a comprehensive immunization register that includes clinical decision support.   The platform can host a patient master index (PMI) or pull patient identifiers from an external PMI. It also supports integration with laboratory and radiology information management systems via an HL7 FHIR compliant API.",

The platform initially was used to support Ebola vaccination studies in the context of a vaccine product development trajectory but quickly was applied in the Public Health context of an Ebola vaccination campaign. Subsequently, the utility and architecture of the platform was broadened to make it supportive of any vaccine type and the platform has since been used in the context of Covid-19 vaccinations. The technology is built on an OpenMRS open source backbone.",

      "Summary": "WHO SMART guidelines - standards-based, machine-readable, adaptive, requirements-based, and testable – comprise of documentation, procedures, and digital health components to steer  localisation and implementation of evidence-based recommendations through digital systems. Use of SMART guidelines results in standards-based, interoperable services and applications that can share accurate data and become part of stronger, more sustainable health information enterprises. ",
      "Description": "In digital systems, SMART Guidelines improve quality of health content and facilitate consistent, standardized collection of data, appropriate decision support, and calculation of indicators across geographies. SMART guidelines content is, by design, software-neutral, formulated for adaptation into whichever software platforms a country has elected to use, within an exchanged digital health enterprise architecture.\n\nTo support the adoption of WHO normative guidance, including evidence-based recommendations, with fidelity in digital systems. SMART guidelines are a package of content tools, which distill WHO guidelines into a format that facilitates translation of clinical, public health, and data recommendations into digital systems. They also leverage open interoperability standards to support adoption of those standards in countries' digital systems.\n\n",
      "PrimaryFunctionality": "There are 5 layers of the SMART Guidelines components:\n- L1: Narrative - Narrative Guidelines: Evidence-based  recommendations and accompanying implementation and data guidance.\n- L2: Operational - Digital Adaptation Kits: “Human readable” software-neutral documentation of operational and functional requirements (e.g. personas, workflows, relevant metadata, transparently documented algorithms, minimum data sets, priority metrics, listing of relevant health interventions, functional requirements).\n- L3: Machine readable - Machine readable recommendations: Structured software-neutral specifications, code, terminology and interoperability standards.\n- L4: Executable - Reference software: Software that are able to execute static algorithms and interoperable digital components to deliver the operational and functional requirements.\n- L5: Dynamic - Precision health model: Executable dynamic algorithms that are trained and optimized with advanced analytics to achieve prioritized outcomes.\n",
      "Users": "The primary users of the SMART Guidelines content are health programme managers, business analysts and technologists who are looking to integrate recommendations into digital systems and Ministries of Health who are responsible for localizing WHO global recommendations into national policies, and operationalization of those policies into digital systems.",
