    "Summary": "The OpenHIM is a middleware component designed to ease interoperability between disparate information systems. It provides secure communications and data governance as well as support for routing, orchestrating, and translating requests as they flow between systems.",
    "Description": "The OpenHIM allows you to secure and view requests to your web service APIs. It acts as a reverse proxy to your upstream services and while doing so enables visibility into your service-oriented architecture (SOA) by logging each request and by providing metrics about requests hitting your services. It also provides a central entry point into your SOA and allows you to secure access through mutual TLS or basic-auth.   The OpenHIM is easy to install and can be easily configured to meet your needs through the administration console. You can also extend the OpenHIM to transform or orchestrate requests through the mediator framework.",

The OpenHIM is also a core component of OpenCRVS. There is anecdotal evidence of OpenHIM being used in several other African countries however due to the open source nature of the software, this is difficult to verify. ",
