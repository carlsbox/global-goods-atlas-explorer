    "Summary": "WHO SMART guidelines - standards-based, machine-readable, adaptive, requirements-based, and testable – comprise of documentation, procedures, and digital health components to steer  localisation and implementation of evidence-based recommendations through digital systems. Use of SMART guidelines results in standards-based, interoperable services and applications that can share accurate data and become part of stronger, more sustainable health information enterprises. ",
    "Description": "In digital systems, SMART Guidelines improve quality of health content and facilitate consistent, standardized collection of data, appropriate decision support, and calculation of indicators across geographies. SMART guidelines content is, by design, software-neutral, formulated for adaptation into whichever software platforms a country has elected to use, within an exchanged digital health enterprise architecture.\n\nTo support the adoption of WHO normative guidance, including evidence-based recommendations, with fidelity in digital systems. SMART guidelines are a package of content tools, which distill WHO guidelines into a format that facilitates translation of clinical, public health, and data recommendations into digital systems. They also leverage open interoperability standards to support adoption of those standards in countries' digital systems.\n\n",
    "PrimaryFunctionality": "There are 5 layers of the SMART Guidelines components:\n- L1: Narrative - Narrative Guidelines: Evidence-based  recommendations and accompanying implementation and data guidance.\n- L2: Operational - Digital Adaptation Kits: “Human readable” software-neutral documentation of operational and functional requirements (e.g. personas, workflows, relevant metadata, transparently documented algorithms, minimum data sets, priority metrics, listing of relevant health interventions, functional requirements).\n- L3: Machine readable - Machine readable recommendations: Structured software-neutral specifications, code, terminology and interoperability standards.\n- L4: Executable - Reference software: Software that are able to execute static algorithms and interoperable digital components to deliver the operational and functional requirements.\n- L5: Dynamic - Precision health model: Executable dynamic algorithms that are trained and optimized with advanced analytics to achieve prioritized outcomes.\n",
    "Users": "The primary users of the SMART Guidelines content are health programme managers, business analysts and technologists who are looking to integrate recommendations into digital systems and Ministries of Health who are responsible for localizing WHO global recommendations into national policies, and operationalization of those policies into digital systems.",
