    "PrimaryFunctionality": "Under the DIPC project, Ona developed the Global Goods Product Suite for Immunization is a collection of open-source digital health tools and frameworks designed to strengthen immunization programs, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Built to be interoperable using HL7 FHIR standards, it showcases how WHO’s SMART Guidelines can be applied to create adaptable, standards-aligned solutions. Core components include OpenSRP2’s Electronic Immunization Register for tracking vaccination records and supporting health workers, DHIS2 for coverage monitoring and analytics, RapidPro for caregiver SMS reminders, and OpenHIM for secure, standards-based data exchange. The suite also supports interoperability with systems such as a Master Patient Index for accurate patient identification, vaccine supply chain management for logistics integration, and a Shared Health Record for continuity of care.",
