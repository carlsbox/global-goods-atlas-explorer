    "Summary": "Tamanu is a free and open-source, patient-level electronic health record (EHR) for desktop and mobile.",
    "Description": " It allows health workers to track individual patients and provide clinical support. Designed specifically for remote settings and the Asia-Pacific context, Tamanu allows health workers to monitor patients in hospitals, health centers, clinics, and even out in the community, enabling consistent, long-term management of patient conditions. The system is offline-first, with syncing capabilities allowing users to work seamlessly with and without an internet connection. The mobile and desktop versions are fully integrated “out-of-the-box”, meaning there are no third-party integrations required for any core features.",
    "PrimaryFunctionality": "At the hospital level, Tamanu Desktop allows a full suite of functionality, including scheduling, admissions, medication orders, location (ward and bed), department management, lab integrations (via SENAITE/Tamanu Lab), discharges, and patient management (including treatment notes). The desktop application works offline, syncing with a central server whenever an internet connection becomes available.\n\nAt the clinic level, Tamanu Mobile offers functionality to capture diagnoses, treatments, vitals, and the recording of events such as births, ante-natal visits, and deaths. It also contains a comprehensive immunization register that includes clinical decision support.   The platform can host a patient master index (PMI) or pull patient identifiers from an external PMI. It also supports integration with laboratory and radiology information management systems via an HL7 FHIR compliant API.",
    "Users": "- Frontline healthcare workers who use Tamanu to record clinical patient information, enabling consistent and long-term management of patients.\n- Hospital and clinic administrative staff who use Tamanu to support the management of patient records, personal information, clinical coding, and billing.\n- Bilateral partners and donors who use Tamanu for reporting purposes.",
