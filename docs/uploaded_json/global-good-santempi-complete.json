    "Summary": "SantéMPI is a proven, next-generation, fully featured Master Patient Index/Client Registry (MPI/CR) platform designed to overcome barriers to leveraging person-centered data as a catalyst for transforming health systems",
    "Description": "It is an essential national digital health infrastructure component that leverages unique identity to facilitate data consolidation, harmonization, sharing, and building health information exchanges (e.g., OpenHIE) to establish interoperability across multiple software solutions. Its flexible architecture and online/offline capability also supports large scale registration programs such as COVID-19 vaccination registration, and birth and death updates to a CRVS. SantéMPI fulfills these essential roles by implementing all relevant interoperability specifications and requirements related to Client Registry in the OpenHIE specification, including Client Registry as a service, HL7 FHIR, and widely deployed legacy standards like HL7v2.",
    "PrimaryFunctionality": "",
    "Users": "Digital health architects, data base managers, software integrators, those responsible for identity management, health information exchange implementers, users of any digital health application that depends on uniquely identifying a person/patient",
