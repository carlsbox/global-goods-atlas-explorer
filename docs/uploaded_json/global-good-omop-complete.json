    "Summary": "The OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) is a standardized framework to harmonize diverse health data sources for research and reporting. It enables interoperability and privacy by allowing shared analytics without sharing patient-level data.",
    "Description": "The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) is a data standard designed to harmonize the structure and content of different types of health data such as electronic health records, insurance claims data, health surveys, and other clinical data sources for federated health research and reporting. Developed by the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) community, the OMOP CDM organizes data into domains or tables representing patient demographics, visits, diagnoses, drugs, measurements (lab tests), procedures, and clinical notes. Interoperability is achieved by sharing computer programs written for the OMOP CDM without the need to share the source data, thereby ensuring patient privacy, and allowing data owners to retain control over their data. \n",
    "PrimaryFunctionality": "The primary function of OMOP CDM is to standardize health data that are in different formats to promote interoperability and collaboration. Analytical tools written for the OMOP CDM can be shared among collaborators without the need to exchange the source data, thus provenance and governance of the data remain with the data owner. Open source OHDSI tools have been created to check the quality of data in an OMOP CDM (consistency, conformance, and plausibility) and to visualize the data according to common subgroups (e.g., sex, year of birth, primary diagnoses, medication usage). Programs can be reused when new data partners join a collaborative effort or when additional data from the same partner becomes available. Results among different data partners can be aggregated to increase statistical power of an analysis, make comparisons of data from different partners, test validity in different contexts, and assess generalizability and the like.
