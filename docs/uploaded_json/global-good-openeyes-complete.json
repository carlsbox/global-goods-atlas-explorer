    "Summary": "OpenEyes is the leading open source electronic patient record (EPR) for ophthalmology. It has been designed by clinicians to be fast in delivering content, fast to navigate, and easy (and fun) to use. ",
    "Description": "OpenEyes benefits from a large and growing body of enthusiastic clinicians determined to make it the EPR that will help health care organisations deliver data-driven patient care in the best way possible. OpenEyes is owned by the community and not by any individual or corporate entity. It can be customised to suit local needs and will scale to connect, seamlessly, primary and secondary eye care. OpenEyes provides an ophthalmic patient record across the globe, enabling clinicians to support clinical pathways such as cataracts, glaucoma, and retinopathy in regions that previously may have had limited access to the tools and resources to so. It is governed, assured, and maintained through the novel Custodian Model, under the custodianship of the Apperta Foundation.",
