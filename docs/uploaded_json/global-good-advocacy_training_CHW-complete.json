The history and background of CHW programs\n2. How to advocate for improved health care and working conditions\n3. How to tell personal stories to advocate for change\n4. How to use technology tools to participate in global conversations\nWe have also created a free Facilitator Guide to assist with in-person and hybrid group learning sessions as well as a Student Guide to guide users through the content.\n",

The content was developed with the Community Health Impact Coalition (CHIC) and an advisory group of community health workers from Kenya, Uganda, Liberia, South Africa, Sierra Leone, Malawi, and Guatemala to ensure that all content is action-oriented and reflects the realities of CHWs’ work and the challenges they face. CHIC and this group of CHW advisors piloted the content and provided feedback on an ongoing basis before its public release.  The training has also been adopted by the Uganda Ministry of Health and is being rolled out as part of their national training curriculum, in collaboration with the Nama Wellness Community Centre in Uganda. The content was initially funded by a Johnson & Johnson grant awarded to the Community Health Impact Coalition, which selected Digital Medic as a sub-grantee and partner to develop and host the content. Digital Medic funds ongoing maintenance of the course through internal operational support as well as grant support through the ELMA Foundation",
