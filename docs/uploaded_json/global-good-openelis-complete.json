    "Summary": "The OpenELIS Global software is an enterprise-level laboratory information system built on open-source web-based technologies that has been tailored for low-and-middle income country public health laboratories.",
    "Description": "OpenELIS offers functionality suitable for supporting jobs and workflows of laboratory technicians, laboratory managers, and public health epidemiologists. Laboratory technicians can use the system to capture data on laboratory orders, tests, and results. Laboratory managers can use the system to track laboratory quality assurance processes. Public health epidemiologists can use OpenELIS data in a central data repository for disease surveillance. The system is suitable for use in any clinical lab, but it is specifically designed for public health labs in limited resource setting",
